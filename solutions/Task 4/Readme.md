   - Click on the **Iteration Path** field and select the sprint (iteration) you want to assign the work item to.
   - Click **Save & Close** to update the work item.

6. **Repeat as Needed:**
   - Continue assigning other work items to the relevant sprints based on your planning.

### 2. Perform Capacity Planning üìä

1. **Navigate to Sprints:**

   - Ensure the total estimated effort of assigned work items does not exceed the team's capacity.

5. **Adjust Work Item Estimates:**
   - If necessary, adjust the effort estimates for work items to fit within the sprint capacity.
   - This can be done by editing the **Effort** or **Story Points** fields in the work item details.

6. **Finalize Sprint Planning:**
   - Once you have allocated all the work items and adjusted estimates, review the sprint backlog.
   - Make any final adjustments as needed and confirm that the sprint plan aligns with the team‚Äôs capacity.

## Additional Notes

- **Team Capacity:** Ensure to regularly update the team‚Äôs capacity to reflect any changes in availability, such as vacations or other commitments.
- **Sprint Duration:** Capacity planning should consider the entire sprint duration to accurately allocate work.
