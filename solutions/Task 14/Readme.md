# üöÄ CI Pipeline Setup for Node.js with npm in Azure DevOps

Welcome! üéâ This guide will help you set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline in Azure DevOps for your Node.js project using npm and Microsoft-hosted agents.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Azure DevOps Account**: Make sure you have an Azure DevOps account. Sign up at [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/).
2. **Node.js Project**: Ensure your Node.js project is ready and pushed to an Azure DevOps repository or another supported version control system.
3. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with Azure DevOps and pipelines.

## üì¶ Setup Steps

### 1. Create a New Project

1. Go to your [Azure DevOps organization](https://dev.azure.com/).
2. Click on **New Project** and provide details (e.g., Project Name, Description).
3. Click **Create**.

### 2. Add Your Code Repository

1. Navigate to the **Repos** section in your project.
2. Import your existing code or push your code from another repository.

### 3. Create a New Pipeline

1. Go to the **Pipelines** section in your project.
2. Click on **Create Pipeline**.
3. Select the repository where your Node.js code is hosted.
4. Choose **YAML** as the pipeline configuration method.

### 4. Define Your Pipeline Configuration

1. Create a file named `azure-pipelines.yml` in your repository‚Äôs root directory.
2. Add the following configuration to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
   - main  # Branch to trigger the pipeline

   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Use Microsoft-hosted Ubuntu agent

   steps:
   - task: UseNode@2
     inputs:
       versionSpec: '16.x'  # Specify the Node.js version

   - script: |
       npm install
       npm test
     displayName: 'Install Dependencies and Run Tests'
   ```

   *Note: Adjust `versionSpec` to match the Node.js version your project requires.*

### 5. Save and Run

1. Commit the `azure-pipelines.yml` file to your repository.
2. Go back to the **Pipelines** section in Azure DevOps.
3. You should see your pipeline listed. Click on it to start the initial run.

### 6. Monitor Your Pipeline

1. After starting the pipeline, monitor its progress from the **Pipelines** dashboard.
2. Check the logs for detailed build and test results.
