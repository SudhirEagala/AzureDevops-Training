# üîç Include Security Scanning for Resources Using CodeQL in Azure DevOps Pipeline

Welcome! üéâ This guide will help you set up security scanning for your code using CodeQL in an Azure DevOps pipeline. CodeQL helps identify vulnerabilities and security issues in your codebase to ensure safer and more secure applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Azure DevOps Account**: Ensure you have an Azure DevOps account. Sign up at [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/).
2. **GitHub Repository**: Your code should be hosted in a GitHub repository.
3. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with Azure DevOps pipelines, GitHub Actions, and basic security scanning concepts.

## üì¶ Set Up Security Scanning with CodeQL

### 1. Create a GitHub Action for Code Scanning

1. **Navigate to GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository where your code is hosted.

2. **Create a Workflow File**:
   - In the repository, go to the `.github/workflows` directory. If it doesn't exist, create it.

3. **Create or Edit `code-scanning.yml`**:
   - Create a new file named `code-scanning.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory.

4. **Add CodeQL Configuration**:
   - Here‚Äôs a sample YAML configuration for setting up CodeQL security scanning:

   ```yaml
   name: CodeQL

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main  # Branch to trigger the workflow
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main  # Branch for pull requests

   jobs:
     analyze:
       name: Analyze code with CodeQL
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v3

       - name: Set up CodeQL
         uses: github/codeql-action/setup@v2
         with:
           languages: 'javascript,python'  # Specify your programming languages

       - name: Autobuild
         uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v2

       - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
         uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
   ```

   *Note: Adjust the `languages` field to match the programming languages used in your project. Add or remove languages as needed.*

### 2. Configure GitHub Code Scanning Alerts

1. **Enable Code Scanning Alerts**:
   - Once the GitHub Actions workflow runs, CodeQL will automatically start scanning your code.
   - Security alerts for vulnerabilities will appear in the **Security** tab of your GitHub repository.

2. **Review Alerts**:
   - Navigate to the **Security** tab in your GitHub repository.
   - Click on **Code scanning alerts** to review the vulnerabilities detected by CodeQL.

## üèóÔ∏è Integrate Code Scanning with Azure DevOps Pipeline

### 1. Trigger GitHub Actions from Azure DevOps Pipeline

1. **Create or Edit `azure-pipelines.yml`**:
   - In the root directory of your Azure DevOps repository, create or edit the `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

2. **Add GitHub Actions Trigger**:
   - Include steps to trigger GitHub Actions workflows from Azure DevOps if desired. For example:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
   - main  # Branch to trigger the pipeline

   jobs:
   - job: TriggerGitHubActions
     steps:
     - script: |
         echo "Triggering GitHub Actions for Code Scanning"
         curl -X POST \
           -H "Authorization: token $(GITHUB_TOKEN)" \
           -d '{"event_type": "trigger-code-scanning"}' \
           https://api.github.com/repos/your-repo/dispatches
       displayName: 'Trigger GitHub Actions'
   ```

   *Note: Replace `your-repo` with your GitHub repository name and set up a GitHub personal access token (PAT) for authentication.*
