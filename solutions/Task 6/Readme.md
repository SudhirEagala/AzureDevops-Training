# Task 6: 🌲 Create a New `develop` Branch from `master` Using VS Code

## Overview

In this task, you'll learn how to create a new branch named `develop` from the `master` branch using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). This allows you to manage your branches and work on new features or fixes independently.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:
- Visual Studio Code installed. [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- The Azure Repos Git repository cloned to your local machine. [Clone a repository](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/clone-repo?view=azure-devops).

## Steps

### 1. Open Your Repository in VS Code 🔍

1. **Launch VS Code:**
   - Open Visual Studio Code on your computer.

2. **Open Your Project:**
   - Click on **File** > **Open Folder** and navigate to the folder containing your cloned repository. Click **Select Folder** to open it in VS Code.

### 2. Check Out the `master` Branch 🔄

1. **Open the Source Control View:**
   - Click on the **Source Control** icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`).

2. **Switch to the `master` Branch:**
   - Click on the branch name displayed in the lower-left corner of VS Code’s status bar. A list of branches will appear.
   - Ensure that `master` is selected. If not, click on `master` to switch to it.

### 3. Create the `develop` Branch 🌟

1. **Open the Branch Menu:**
   - Click on the branch name in the lower-left corner of the status bar again. This time, select **Create New Branch** from the menu.

2. **Name the New Branch:**
   - Enter `develop` as the name for your new branch.
   - Press `Enter` to create and switch to the `develop` branch.

### 4. Verify the New Branch ✅

1. **Check the Active Branch:**
   - Verify that the status bar now displays `develop` as the current branch.

2. **View Branches:**
   - You can also check the list of branches by clicking on the branch icon in the Source Control view. Ensure that `develop` appears in the list of branches.

## Additional Notes

- **Branch Strategy:** Consider using branching strategies like Git Flow or GitHub Flow to manage your branches effectively.
- **Commit Changes:** Remember to commit any changes made on the `develop` branch to keep your work safe.
- **Documentation:** For more detailed information on using Git with VS Code, consult the [VS Code Git documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol).

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have successfully created a new `develop` branch from `master` using Visual Studio Code. This setup allows you to work on new features or fixes in isolation from the main production branch.
