# üîê Securely Include Secrets in Azure DevOps Pipelines Using Azure Key Vault

Welcome! üéâ In this guide, we‚Äôll show you how to securely manage and use secrets in your Azure DevOps pipelines by integrating with Azure Key Vault. This ensures that sensitive information is protected and managed efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Azure DevOps Account**: Make sure you have an Azure DevOps account. Sign up at [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/).
2. **Azure Key Vault**: Create an Azure Key Vault in your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and add the necessary secrets.
3. **Azure Subscription**: You need an Azure subscription to create and manage resources.
4. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with Azure DevOps pipelines and Azure Key Vault.

## üîë Set Up Azure Key Vault

### 1. Create and Configure Key Vault

1. **Create Key Vault**:
   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - Search for **Key Vault** and create a new Key Vault.

2. **Add Secrets**:
   - Navigate to your Key Vault.
   - Click on **Secrets** and then **+ Generate/Import** to add secrets.
   - Enter a name and value for each secret, then click **Create**.

3. **Access Policies**:
   - Go to the **Access policies** section in Key Vault.
   - Click on **+ Add Access Policy**.
   - Select **Azure DevOps** as the principal or create a service principal with appropriate permissions.
   - Grant **Get** and **List** permissions to secrets.
   - Click **Add** and then **Save**.

## üîó Link Azure Key Vault to Azure DevOps

### 1. Configure Service Connection in Azure DevOps

1. **Navigate to Project Settings**:
   - In your Azure DevOps project, go to **Project Settings** (bottom-left corner).

2. **Service Connections**:
   - Under **Pipelines**, select **Service connections**.
   - Click on **New service connection** and select **Azure Resource Manager**.

3. **Set Up Connection**:
   - Choose **Service principal (automatic)**.
   - Select your Azure subscription and the Key Vault you created.
   - Verify and save the connection.

## üõ†Ô∏è Use Secrets in Your Pipeline

### 1. Modify Your Pipeline YAML

1. **Create or Edit `azure-pipelines.yml`**:
   - In the root directory of your repository, create or edit the `azure-pipelines.yml` file.

2. **Add Key Vault Task**:
   - Use the `AzureKeyVault@2` task to fetch secrets from Key Vault and use them in your pipeline. Here‚Äôs an example YAML configuration:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
   - main  # Branch to trigger the pipeline

   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Use Microsoft-hosted Ubuntu agent

   steps:
   - task: AzureKeyVault@2
     inputs:
       azureSubscription: 'YourAzureServiceConnection'
       KeyVaultName: 'YourKeyVaultName'
       SecretsFilter: '*'  # Use '*' to fetch all secrets or specify a comma-separated list

   - script: |
       echo $(YOUR_SECRET_NAME)  # Use the secret in your pipeline
     displayName: 'Display Secret'
   ```

   *Note: Replace `YourAzureServiceConnection` and `YourKeyVaultName` with your actual service connection name and Key Vault name. Replace `YOUR_SECRET_NAME` with the name of the secret you want to access.*

### 2. Save and Run

1. **Commit YAML File**:
   - Commit the `azure-pipelines.yml` file to your repository.

2. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Go back to the **Pipelines** section in Azure DevOps.
   - You should see your pipeline listed. Click on it to start the pipeline and verify that secrets are being accessed correctly.
