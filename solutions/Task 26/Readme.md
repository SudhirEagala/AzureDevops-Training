# üì¶ Create Docker Image Using Dockerfile

Welcome! üéâ This guide will walk you through the steps to create a Docker image using a Dockerfile for a simple Node.js application. We‚Äôll include a sample `app.js` file to demonstrate how everything fits together.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Docker Installed**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with Docker and basic command-line usage.

## üì¶ Create a Docker Image Using Dockerfile

### 1. Prepare Your Application

1. **Create a Project Directory**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Create and navigate to your project directory:

     ```bash
     mkdir my-node-app
     cd my-node-app
     ```

2. **Create `package.json`**:
   - Initialize a new Node.js project and create a `package.json` file:

     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```

3. **Create `app.js`**:
   - Create a file named `app.js` in your project directory with the following content:

   ```javascript
   // app.js
   const http = require('http');
   const port = 3000;

   const requestHandler = (request, response) => {
     response.end('Hello, World!');
   };

   const server = http.createServer(requestHandler);

   server.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   - For this simple app, no additional dependencies are required, but you can add any dependencies to `package.json` as needed.

### 2. Create a Dockerfile

1. **Create Dockerfile**:
   - In your project directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` (without any extension) with the following content:

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use the official Node.js image as a base image
   FROM node:14

   # Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /usr/src/app

   # Copy package.json and package-lock.json files
   COPY package*.json ./

   # Install the application dependencies
   RUN npm install

   # Copy the rest of the application code
   COPY . .

   # Expose the port on which the app will run
   EXPOSE 3000

   # Define the command to run the application
   CMD ["node", "app.js"]
   ```

   *Note: This Dockerfile uses the Node.js 14 image, installs dependencies, copies application code, and sets up the container to run `app.js`.*

### 3. Build the Docker Image

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   - Run the following command in your project directory:

     ```bash
     docker build -t my-node-app:latest .
     ```

   - `-t my-node-app:latest` tags the image with the name `my-node-app` and the tag `latest`.
   - `.` specifies the build context, which is the current directory.

2. **Verify the Docker Image**:
   - List your Docker images to verify that the image was created successfully:

     ```bash
     docker images
     ```

   - You should see `my-node-app` listed with the `latest` tag.

### 4. Run Your Docker Image

1. **Run the Docker Container**:
   - Start a container from your image using the following command:

     ```bash
     docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app:latest
     ```

   - This maps port 3000 on your host to port 3000 in the container.

2. **Verify the Application**:
   - Open a web browser or use `curl` to check if your application is running:

     ```bash
     curl http://localhost:3000
     ```

   - You should see the response `Hello, World!` if the application is running correctly.
