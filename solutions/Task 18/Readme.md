# üåê Deploy Your App to Azure Web App Using Azure DevOps

Welcome! üéâ In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through the steps to deploy your application to an Azure Web App using Azure DevOps. This will automate your deployment process and ensure that your app is always up-to-date.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Azure DevOps Account**: Ensure you have an Azure DevOps account. Sign up at [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/).
2. **Azure Web App**: Create an Azure Web App in your [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Ensure you have the necessary credentials and configuration details.
3. **Code Repository**: Your application code should be pushed to an Azure DevOps repository or another supported version control system.
4. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with Azure DevOps pipelines and Azure Web Apps.

## üì¶ Set Up the Deployment Pipeline

### 1. Create a New Pipeline

1. **Navigate to Pipelines**:
   - Go to the **Pipelines** section in your Azure DevOps project.
   - Click on **Create Pipeline**.

2. **Select Repository**:
   - Choose the repository where your application code is stored.

3. **Configure Pipeline**:
   - Select **YAML** or **Classic Editor** depending on your preference. This guide will use **YAML**.

### 2. Define Your YAML Configuration

1. **Create or Edit `azure-pipelines.yml`**:
   - In the root directory of your repository, create a file named `azure-pipelines.yml` (or edit an existing one).

2. **Add Deployment Configuration**:
   - Use the following sample YAML configuration to deploy your app to an Azure Web App:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
   - main  # Branch to trigger the pipeline

   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Use Microsoft-hosted Ubuntu agent

   steps:
   - task: UseNode@2
     inputs:
       versionSpec: '16.x'  # Specify Node.js version if applicable

   - script: |
       npm install
       npm build  # Adjust according to your build process
     displayName: 'Install Dependencies and Build'

   - task: AzureRmWebAppDeployment@4
     inputs:
       azureSubscription: 'YourAzureSubscriptionName'
       appType: 'webApp'
       WebAppName: 'YourWebAppName'
       package: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/**/*.zip'  # Adjust the path to your build artifact
   ```

   *Note: Replace placeholders like `YourAzureSubscriptionName` and `YourWebAppName` with your actual Azure subscription name and Web App name.*

### 3. Save and Run

1. **Commit YAML File**:
   - Commit the `azure-pipelines.yml` file to your repository.

2. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Go back to the **Pipelines** section.
   - You should see your pipeline listed. Click on it to start the deployment.

### 4. Monitor Your Deployment

1. **Check Status**:
   - Monitor the pipeline‚Äôs progress from the **Pipelines** dashboard.
   - Review the logs to ensure the deployment was successful.
