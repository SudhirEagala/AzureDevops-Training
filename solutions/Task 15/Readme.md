# üöÄ CI Pipeline Setup with Self-Hosted Agent in Azure DevOps

Welcome! üéâ In this guide, we'll set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline in Azure DevOps using a self-hosted agent for your Node.js project with npm. This setup is useful when you need custom configurations or specific environments that Microsoft-hosted agents can't provide.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Azure DevOps Account**: Ensure you have an Azure DevOps account. Sign up at [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/).
2. **Node.js Project**: Your Node.js project should be pushed to an Azure DevOps repository or another supported version control system.
3. **Self-Hosted Agent**: Set up a machine (physical or virtual) to act as your self-hosted agent. This machine should have Node.js and npm installed.
4. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with Azure DevOps and pipelines.

## üè† Set Up Your Self-Hosted Agent

### 1. Prepare Your Machine

1. Ensure the machine has the necessary software installed:
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

2. Make sure the machine meets the system requirements for a self-hosted agent. Check [Azure DevOps Agent Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-windows?view=azure-devops) for more details.

### 2. Register Your Self-Hosted Agent

1. Go to your [Azure DevOps organization](https://dev.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to **Project Settings** (bottom-left corner).
3. Under **Pipelines**, click on **Agent Pools**.
4. Click on **Add Pool** to create a new agent pool if you don't already have one.
5. Select the agent pool you want to use or create a new one.
6. Click on **New Agent** and select your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
7. Follow the instructions to download and configure the agent on your machine. You‚Äôll need to:
   - Download the agent package.
   - Extract the package.
   - Configure the agent using the command line (you'll need a personal access token for authentication).

### 3. Start the Agent

1. After configuration, start the agent on your machine by running the appropriate command (e.g., `run.cmd` for Windows or `run.sh` for Linux/macOS).

## üì¶ Set Up the CI Pipeline

### 1. Create a New Pipeline

1. Go to the **Pipelines** section in your project.
2. Click on **Create Pipeline**.
3. Select the repository where your Node.js code is hosted.
4. Choose **YAML** as the pipeline configuration method.

### 2. Define Your Pipeline Configuration

1. Create a file named `azure-pipelines.yml` in your repository‚Äôs root directory.
2. Add the following configuration to your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
   - main  # Branch to trigger the pipeline

   pool:
     name: 'YourAgentPoolName'  # Replace with your agent pool name

   steps:
   - task: UseNode@2
     inputs:
       versionSpec: '16.x'  # Specify the Node.js version

   - script: |
       npm install
       npm test
     displayName: 'Install Dependencies and Run Tests'
   ```

   *Note: Adjust `versionSpec` to match the Node.js version your project requires and `YourAgentPoolName` to your actual agent pool name.*

### 3. Save and Run

1. Commit the `azure-pipelines.yml` file to your repository.
2. Go back to the **Pipelines** section in Azure DevOps.
3. You should see your pipeline listed. Click on it to start the initial run.

### 4. Monitor Your Pipeline

1. Monitor the pipeline's progress from the **Pipelines** dashboard.
2. Check the logs for detailed build and test results.
