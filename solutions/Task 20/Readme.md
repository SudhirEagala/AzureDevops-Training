# üîç Implement CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions with Code Scanning

Welcome! üéâ In this guide, we‚Äôll set up a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions for your application. We‚Äôll also include code scanning to ensure your codebase remains secure and high-quality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository**: Your application code should be stored in a GitHub repository.
2. **GitHub Actions Access**: Ensure you have access to GitHub Actions in your repository.
3. **Basic Knowledge**: Familiarity with GitHub Actions, YAML syntax, and basic CI/CD concepts.

## üì¶ Set Up GitHub Actions

### 1. Create a Workflow File

1. **Navigate to Actions**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on the **Actions** tab.

2. **Set Up Workflow**:
   - Click **Set up a workflow yourself** or **New workflow** if prompted.
   - This will create a new `.github/workflows` directory with a workflow YAML file.

### 2. Define Your Workflow Configuration

1. **Create or Edit `ci-cd.yml`**:
   - In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named `ci-cd.yml` (or edit an existing one).

2. **Add CI/CD Configuration**:
   - Here‚Äôs a sample YAML configuration for a Node.js application that includes build, test, deployment, and code scanning:

   ```yaml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main  # Branch to trigger the pipeline
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main  # Branch for pull requests

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout Code
         uses: actions/checkout@v3

       - name: Set up Node.js
         uses: actions/setup-node@v3
         with:
           node-version: '16.x'  # Specify Node.js version

       - name: Install Dependencies
         run: npm install

       - name: Run Tests
         run: npm test

       - name: Build
         run: npm run build

     deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       needs: build
       steps:
       - name: Checkout Code
         uses: actions/checkout@v3

       - name: Deploy to Production
         run: |
           echo "Deploying to production..."
           # Add your deployment commands here, e.g., using SSH or deployment scripts.

     code-scanning:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - name: Checkout Code
         uses: actions/checkout@v3

       - name: Code Scanning
         uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
         with:
           languages: 'javascript'  # Specify your programming language

       - name: Run Code Scanning
         uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
   ```

   *Note: Adjust the `node-version` to match the version your project uses. Customize the `Deploy to Production` step with your actual deployment process.*

### 3. Enable Code Scanning

1. **Set Up Code Scanning Alerts**:
   - GitHub CodeQL is used for code scanning in the example. Code scanning alerts will be available in the **Security** tab of your GitHub repository.

2. **Configure Additional Code Scanners** (Optional):
   - You can integrate other code scanning tools or security checks as needed by adding additional steps to the workflow.

## üèóÔ∏è Save and Commit

1. **Commit Workflow File**:
   - Commit the `ci-cd.yml` file to your repository.

2. **Push Changes**:
   - Push the changes to your repository. This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.

## üìà Monitor Your Workflow

1. **Check Workflow Status**:
   - Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
   - Monitor the status of your workflow runs, including build, test, deployment, and code scanning.

2. **Review Logs and Results**:
   - Click on individual workflow runs to view detailed logs and results for each step.
   - Check code scanning results under the **Security** tab.
